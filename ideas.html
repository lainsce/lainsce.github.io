                    <h2><i class="fa fa-fw fa-info"></i> Intro</h2>
                    <p>It's my main belief that we should always strive to explain ourselves no matter the subject, in a didatical way, and to also share our ideas and tools with others, with no barriers.</p>

                <div class="half economy">
                  <div class="card">
                    <p data-align="center"><i class="fa fa-4x fa-usd"></i></p>
                    <h2 data-align="center">Economy</h2>

                    <h3>Implement Universal Basic Income</h3>
                    <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Pq-S557XQU">Job automation is looming in the shadows</a>, but more than that, it is good for society that it appers someday. We should strive for a future where people are no longer coearced societally to find work. UBI allows for an updated economy where not having jobs doesn't mean failure.</p>

                    <h3>Abolish Unnecessary Taxes</h3>
                    <p>Current state has some taxes that either are stuck in victorian times, or didn't update to our current technologies. One such tax is the 75% tax on video games, because in the law corpus, these objects are compared to gambling products.</p>

                    <h3>Abolish Minimum Wage</h3>
                    <p>Experts in economy say that raising the minimum wage <a href="http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/nov/06/ben-cardin/does-raising-minimum-wage-result-job-growth/">is either harmful or has no effect</a>. Universal Basic Income would allow us to abolish the minimum wage, creating a free-er market by lowering costs of production. </p>

                    <h2 data-align="center">Technology</h2>
                    <h3>Abolish the Remnants of Protectionism in Tech</h3>
                    <p>Today, we live in a mixed politics-economy model, with remnants of protectionism being heavily positioned in technology and tech products. In a possible future, we could abolish those little problems and expect national growth, after failing to secure a national industry in tech, but a massive growth in international companies serving us goods, making us updated to live in the current century. </p>
                    <h3>Lean Copyright and abolish DRM</h3>
                    <p>Copyright is something of a law that is expected to stil be a thing in the foreseeable future. This means of securing the author's ideas is outdated for the fast, growing, and virtual world we live in today. One such spawn of the Copyright building, is the DRM. DRM is a piece of code embedded in media that limits your freedoms on where you can play it, to make you lock-in to a certain site or app. It's a poison of the virtual world, and so, we must fight to kill it.</p>
                    <h3>Approve the Use of Ethical Torrenting</h3>
                    <p>Torrents today are seen as a maladie and something we should combat and get rid of. That thought is dangerous. We've grown to such a huge civilization, sprawling an entire planet, albeit not united under a single banner like Coruscant. Do you see the benefits in using a unified format on which we can share ideas, media, and human produced conent? Yeah, me too. So we must fight to secure torrent as a viable means of sharing media, by ethically using it.</p>

                    <h2 data-align="center">Health</h2>
                    <h3>Improve the Unified System of Healthcare</h3>
                    <p>We must fight to modernize what we already fought for. It's sad to see our public unified hospitals in such a sorry state. Starting by raising funds either locally or digitally so that the public hospitals get the equipment they deserve and the personnel they need.</p>
                    <h3>Transhumanism (h+)</h3>
                    <p>There has been much development in this area of technology, with movable limbs and artificial organs. Let's see that idea grow between healthy humans willing to enhance their parts for improved parts, e.g. a heart that never dysregulates or a pancreas that does not get insulin-deficient. Imagine the possibilities!</p>

                    <h2 data-align="center">Energy</h2>
                    <h3>Improve the Current Energy Grid</h3>
                    <p>Improving the current grid will make our energy output demands less pricey for the populace, and in doing so removing the need for illegal grid amending; thereby making energy taxes cheaper and more accessible in less-wealthy neighborhoods.</p>
