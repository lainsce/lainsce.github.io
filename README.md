# Lains

Hi! I'm Lains, also known as Paulo Galardi, I'm 24 years old, and I love to program things!
I'm a developer of many apps on ![elementary OS](https://elementary.io).

My apps are as follows:

![Notejot](https://lainsce.github.io/notejot)
- Stupidly simple sticky notes applet.

![Quilter](https://lainsce.github.io/quilter)
- Focus on your writing.

![Coin](https://lainsce.github.io/coin)
- Track the virtual currencies in real world currency value.
