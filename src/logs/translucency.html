      <h2>TRANSLUCENCY</h2>
      <h4>On Translucent Widgets - 760:430 20N14</h4>

      <h2>Introduction</h2>>
      <p>In this article, I want to expose and detail what the translucency effect can add to an existing user
        interface, and demystify the preconcept that translucency is just used for "pretty UI" and "good looks".</p>

      <h2>History</h2>
      <p>Translucency has come from a series of user interface advancements, and research that was piled onto existing
        paradigms; it is the most recent advancement in UI, and for a good cause; it has come from the idea that user
        interfaces can do more for the user, in terms of guidance for the overall first state of an UI.
        Back in the 70's, computers were able to just display text. That's it. Not a single drawn interface. Just
        scrolled text, with no way to go back, unless printed on a roll of paper by the main frame. A basic interface
        for the users, which were a small amount, as nobody almost knew what a computer even was, at this time.
        Come the 80's, and computers have started to go toward a better user facing interface, with primitive buttons,
        and forms, with windows; all in glorious 1-bit. This is where some companies have started to put the gears in
        motion that the care for the user-computer connection had to be more than this. So, some set to make text look
        positively stunning for that era, with fonts (a novelty for that era) and a care for interface to look inviting
        to use, and some primitive ideas about layoutting.
        At the tail end of the 80's interfaces were starting to shape for what's to come. Companies started making small
        divisions all about design and development of interfaces, often paired with extensive, at the time, teams of
        psychologists and also other fields as needed. Primitive paradigms of layoutting started to take shape here.
        This is the crux point of user interfaces; as researchers started making advancements, interfaces were evolving
        at a fast pace. Users started to have more tech at home, and with this growing demand for computing, there was
        it, the 90's boom. Suddenly, almost every (medium income) home worldwide had a computer or had a center nearby
        with computers for use (LAN houses, as they were called.)
        This is where users started seeing that computers were easier to use than before, and a new generation started
        their existence living inside a world filled with technology.
        Then, the 2000's started. That was a time in which the design think-tank never stopped treading, however gaudy
        the interface was, they wanted it done. Glossy button, cartoon helpers, you name it. Operating Systems were
        teeming with almost all the interfaces you could ever think; the birth of skeuomorphism in computer interfaces.
        That was it, the best way to introduce people to computers, is if they deal with things they see in real life.
        Wooden windows, green felt panes, address book styled contacts app. It was in hindsight, the most gaudy of eras,
        but in actuality, at the time, this was needed to impulse the availability of computers to even those
        illiterate, to use.
        It was at this point, that designers stepped back, and thought to themselves in a sort of zeitgeist phenomenon:
        "Let's step back to the roots of our machine interactions, and use those Swiss Design patterns lauded in the
        50's for text and diagramming; that'll surely be what advances us from this complexity." This was the birth of
        Flat Design. Gone is the green felt, bubbly buttons, etc. and in comes the text driven interface; things are
        meant to be form over function in the past now; we must value function now or perish our search for the best UI.
        In Flat Design, chrome (or non-content) is eliminated wherever possible.
        This is where another 90's boom happened, this time with research of User Experience and User Interfaces, and
        how it should look and feel for a better experience. Gestalt principles were abided by, like golden rules (More
        on that later.) Basically, all design of user interfacing was starting to be rebuilt for the best research yet
        again.
        And then comes the recent era of today. Companies' design divisions have built separate yet almost too closely
        related interfaces, all built upon the flat interface, to make it more in tune with human brain functionality
        and the perception of things, rather than just make it look as good as it can no matter what (gaudy 2000's UI).
        One such recentish invention, is the use of shadows to imply that elements sit in a 3D space, also known as
        spatial-aware design. The search for this same spatial-aware design, also has given us yet another recent
        invention; frosted/translucent interfaces.</p>

      <h2>Translucency</h2>
      <p>So, what does translucency entail, and why does everybody use it in interface nowadays? It's very simple.
        Remember back, when I mentioned the Gestalt Principles applied to design? Yeah, this is an invention in
        interfaces, that uses the Figure-Background principle:</p>
      <q>Figure–ground organization is a type of perceptual grouping that is a vital necessity for recognizing objects
        through vision. In Gestalt psychology it is known as identifying a figure from the background. For example,
        black words on a printed paper are seen as the "figure," and the white sheet as the "background".</q>
      <p>This helps the user's perception of what is the flow of usage of that certain app. Designers have now started
        using this to make sidebars, for example, fade on the attention level for users, and focus on the main content
        of an app instead of having multiple layers of the same app competing for attention, and adding, shockingly,
        mental overload. Humans weren't meant to focus on tonnes of many things at once, so the translucency helps
        understate parts of the UI that aren't important to be glanced over as primary targets. As Apple puts it (Note:
        they refer to objects with translucency as Materials),</p>
      <q>The effect of a Material lets views and controls hint at background content without distracting from foreground
        content. To produce this effect, Materials allow background color information to pass through foreground views,
        while also blurring the background context to maintain legibility.</q>

      <p>The key part here, is that the translucency shouldn't be too transparent while also not having a lack of a
        strong blur either, both measures to avoid hurting legibility and contrast of text and background. Let's see how
        Microsoft puts it (They refer to translucency as Acrylic):</p>
      <q>The things that surround us in the real world are sensory and invigorating. They bend, stretch, bounce,
        shatter, and glide. Those material qualities translate to digital environments, making people want to reach out
        and touch our designs. Acrylic is one such material, that helps you create modern, bold UI that incorporates
        light, depth, motion, material, and scale.</q>
      <p>As you can infer from both quotes, translucency aims to make the UI that much closer to interactions that our
        brain percieves the world with, and as bonus points, refreshes the interface with the utmost care and detail.
      </p>

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>And so, I hope that with this article, you may exit convinced of the usefulness of applying translucency to
        your interfaces, upgrading the user interaction to what's the most modern, and reducing mental overload for your
        users. Translucency is here to stay, as it's the most recent invention made by professional designers paired
        with psychology in mind to help make the world of computing that much more easier to deal with, even if that
        feels weird to read but you must understand that they poured years of research before applying this onto the end
        user.</p>
