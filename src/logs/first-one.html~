    <p>This is but one of the logs I'll be adding here, each of them will be succinct
    and not go for more than 7 lines, except if it has more to say. This one is an
    exception as it's the first one. Y'know, the introduction to all the logs.
    I'm starting this to build my skill of writing lengthy things, because I'm too
    much poor in that regard. I don't often write too much out of habit, and I need
    to break off of it. I need to build up my writing skills, otherwise it'll decay
    fast, and I'm not wanting any of that. Whew, it seems I did a 7-liner as my intro.
