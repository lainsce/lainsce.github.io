                <p><span class="start-letter">I</span> have been using the Nataniev systems for almost a week now
                extensively, hiding Old World clocks and calendars whenever possible. It has shifted my perception
                of time quite considerably. I feel like days take longer to complete, and cramming tasks in them is
                quite easier. I dunno about the psychological effects of a longer day each day, but I'm thankful about
                it. The old me would procastinate quite frequently, leaving days of my life without purpose or reason.
                Now, after using it, I can only recommend it for fixing a procastination heavy brain, if you have one.
                What I mainly feel, is that an amazing journey is ahead of me. With Niu assisting me, I don't have need
                for the default time and date indicator in elementary OS. I can just ditch that. Mayhaps, I'll end the O
                Month by figuring out a way to do notifications to rest or to stand every 15 and 30 pulses and add that
                to Niu...

              <div class="left card-text-long">
                <p><span class="start-letter">T</span>oday, I've finished another app, called Niu. This app does one
                    thing for me, and that is, it helps me use the Nataniev system in elementary OS. I've talked about
                    the system, but never got to show how it works. It's composed of two concepts: Arvelie and
                    Neralie. Both deal with timekeeping in a different way.
                    <br><br>For Arvelie,<br>
                    Each month has 2 weeks of 7 days, and each month is a letter of the alphabet.
                    The 365th day of the year is the Year Day(+01), preceded by the Leap Day(+02) on leap years.<br>
                    <pre><code>
Jan/1 - A
Jan/2 - B
...
Dec/2 - Z
                    </code></pre><br>
                    For example, now as of writing, it is 19O05. And my birthday was 93L03.
                    (Mark that on your Arvelie calendar!)
                    <br><br>For Neralie,<br>
                    There is the concept of Beats and Pulses, and each of those custom measurements have values
                    fixed on the second and are quite easy to understand:<br>
                    <pre><code>
1 s = 1.157 bs
1 min = 69.42 bs
1 bs = 86.4 s
1 ps = 8.64 min
1000 bs = 1 ps
1000 ps = 1 day
                    </code></pre><br>
                    Neralie's notation is also quite simple:<br>
                    <pre><code>
[ps]:[bs]
example: 945:127
                    </code></pre><br>
                    And here's cardinal points of interest for Neralie:<br>
                    000:000 = 12 AM<br>
                    250:000 = 6 AM<br>
                    500:000 = 12 PM<br>
                    750:000 = 6 PM<br>

                    Anyhoo, hope you enjoyed learning about this system as much as I like it!

                <p><span class="start-letter">E</span>very day, I try to follow a strict program almost like a robot,
                    but this programming is good for what I do, which is code at home. I always try to do at least
                    one thing, and I have done so since 19O01 (after restarting due to backup failures). It's been a
                    strange yet fulfilling journey. I also make sure to log it into a (big by now) text file which is
                    structured like a Markdown table, with the task code for the day, the day task, and how many beats
                    were used for that task.
                    <br><br>An example:<br>
                    <pre><code>

DATE  CODE  DESC                  BEATS
19O04 1A    Logged a naxasero     7
  *   1B    Clark New Album       2
  *   2A    Write parser for this 15
  *   1A    Logged a naxasero     7

                    </code></pre><br>
                    As you can see, every task has a code. To understand my codes, you need to understand that I
                    divide things into three sections: Leisure, Work, and Research.
                    Each of those is a number; respectively, 1, 2, and 3.
                    A Table for each level and code follows:<br>
                    </p>
                    <table class=".table">
                      <tr>
                        <th>Leisure (1)</th>
                        <th>Work (2)</th>
                        <th>Research (3)</th>
                      </tr>
                      <tr>
                        <td>A - Text</td>
                        <td>A - Code</td>
                        <td>A - Read</td>
                      </tr>
                      <tr>
                        <td>B - Audio</td>
                        <td>B - Build</td>
                        <td>B - Listen</td>
                      </tr>
                      <tr>
                        <td>C - Video</td>
                        <td>C - Design</td>
                        <td>C - Explore</td>
                      </tr>
                      <tr>
                        <td>D - Idle</td>
                        <td>D - Idle</td>
                        <td>D - Idle</td>
                      </tr>
                    </table><br>
                    That's it. So, a 1A code corresponds to a leisure activity about text. I also make sure to diversify
                    tasks so that no task takes all the day, even if it should. The amount of beats also is a deciding
                    factor about whether I should move on, as if a task exceeds 30 beats on the day, it's time to take
                    a break.

                   As you can see, these naxaserom about anything will be in little cards like these. As an introductory
                   naxasero, this one will have nothing in it, per usual. It should start being interesting by the next one.
                   Hope you'll gather anything by these. Since the page is in a static platform, these naxaserom will not
                   contain personal things such as addresses or personal photos.
                   Naxasero is a word that comes from my constructed language Sayala, and its definition is in the header.
                   It's basically a blog, but there's a rule: at most 15 lines of content and a marked initial letter.
                   That is what defines a naxasero from anything else. Also, you may think, what even is that time tag on
                   this? That's by another person's idea, Devine, my friend. The Horarie System, more specifically, the
                   Arvelie calendar. I'll leave a link to it on this naxasero. Until the next one~</p>
