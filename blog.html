                        <p><span class="start-letter">T</span>his month (in Nataniev terms) I've started a new project called Niu, which
                            set to show the Nataniev Neralie & Arvelie exocortex timekeeping systems to the users of elementary OS. So,
                            today, 19O08, the task was to  add a Pomodoro system entirely in Neralie, to the app. This proved difficult
                            at first, but then, after much trial and error, I got it to work. The only thing that might make me worried
                            for now, is if the alerts clash with each other. But as with every other task, I've done enough today for
                            this. Time to hit the big show and actually have Niu in AppCenter! And with that, extensive user coverage
                            will help me know if the thing I made needs more adjusting or even other forms of coding. Every day Vala
                            surprises me. Just recently I've learnt how to deal with dates and times using <code>GLib.DateTime</code>.

                                the rain of naxaserom that will happen eventually. Someday, I will make a sidebar for these things. Maybe
                                when the O Month ends? Anyhow, I'll have to fit a sidebar. And with CSS and HTML, it's going to get tougher.
                                Mayhaps I'll look at templated sidebars. Or maybe I'll finally take courage, and implement this site as a
                                Riven database. Who knows? I've also reduced this site's size by almost 64%! It's incredible how fat
                                FontAwesome is! Almost 35MB just for icons to put on the site! It's too much for the new life I'm tracing,
                                of efficiency and KISS principle in every corner. I also, for some ungodly reason, was using links to images,
                                instead of saving them locally and linking via CSS. Such a waste! And also, if there's no good internet
                                connection, the site would look unfinished. All remedied!

                                    extensively, hiding Old World clocks and calendars whenever possible. It has shifted my perception
                                    of time quite considerably. I feel like days take longer to complete, and cramming tasks in them is
                                    quite easier. I dunno about the psychological effects of a longer day each day, but I'm thankful about
                                    it. The old me would procastinate quite frequently, leaving days of my life without purpose or reason.
                                    Now, after using it, I can only recommend it for fixing a procastination heavy brain, if you have one.
                                    What I mainly feel, is that an amazing journey is ahead of me. With Niu assisting me, I don't have need
                                    for the default time and date indicator in elementary OS. I can just ditch that. Mayhaps, I'll end the O

                                        thing for me, and that is, it helps me use the Nataniev system in elementary OS. I've talked about
                                        the system, but never got to show how it works. It's composed of two concepts: Arvelie and
                                        Neralie. Both deal with timekeeping in a different way.
                                        For Arvelie,
                                        Each month has 2 weeks of 7 days, and each month is a letter of the alphabet.
                                        The 365th day of the year is the Year Day(+01), preceded by the Leap Day(+02) on leap years.

                                        For example, now as of writing, it is 19O05. And my birthday was 93L02.
                                        (Mark that on your Arvelie calendar!)
                                        For Neralie,
                                        There is the concept of Beats and Pulses, and each of those custom measurements have values
                                        fixed on the second and are quite easy to understand:
                                        <pre><code>
1 s = 1.157 bs
1 min = 69.42 bs
1 bs = 86.4 s
1 ps = 8.64 min
1000 bs = 1 ps
1000 ps = 1 day
                                        </code></pre>
                                        Neralie's notation is also quite simple:
                                        <pre><code>
[ps]:[bs]
example: 945:127
                                        </code></pre>
                                        And here's cardinal points of interest for Neralie:
                                        000:000 = 12 AM
                                        250:000 = 6 AM
                                        500:000 = 12 PM
                                        750:000 = 6 PM
                                        Anyhoo, hope you enjoyed learning about this system as much as I like it!

                                        That's it. So, a 1I code corresponds to a leisure activity about text. I also make sure to diversify
                                        tasks so that no task takes all the day, even if it should. The amount of beats also is a deciding
                                        factor about whether I should move on, as if a task exceeds 30 beats on the day, it's time to take
                                        a break.

                                            As you can see, these naxaserom about anything will be in little cards like these. As an introductory
                                            naxasero, this one will have nothing in it, per usual. It should start being interesting by the next one.
                                            Hope you'll gather anything by these. Since the page is in a static platform, these naxaserom will not
                                            contain personal things such as addresses or personal photos.
                                            Naxasero is a word that comes from my constructed language Sayala, and its definition is in the header.
                                            It's basically a blog, but there's a rule: at most 15 lines of content and a marked initial letter.
                                            That is what defines a naxasero from anything else. Also, you may think, what even is that time tag on
                                            this? That's by another person's idea, Devine, my friend. The Nataniev System, more specifically, the
                                            Arvelie calendar. I'll leave a link to it on this naxasero. Until the next one~</p>
